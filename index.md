# 🏋️ Sole Fitness Business Analytics Project

This project was completed as part of the NUS Master of Technology in Enterprise Business Analytics programme.  
We collaborated with a Singapore-based e-commerce SME to integrate analytics by creating a unified data base, formulating metrics to diversify revenue and optimise advertising expenditure.

## 🎯 Project Highlights

- 📦 **Data Integration**: Designed a normalised **PostgreSQL** database consolidating website, Shopee, and Lazada sales data.
- 📊 **Dashboard Development**: Built **Power BI** dashboards to visualise sales trends, product performance, and business KPIs.
- 🧠 **Clustering Analysis**: Applied **K-Means** clustering to segment products and identify underperformers for revenue diversification.
- 📈 **Ad Spend Optimisation**: Created a **ROAS** (Return on Ad Spend) metric and used correlation analysis to uncover inefficiencies, enabling a **4% reduction in advertising costs**.

> 💡 *Note: As this project was conducted for a live business, datasets are confidential. However, the report and code provide sufficient context to understand the scope and solutions delivered.*
